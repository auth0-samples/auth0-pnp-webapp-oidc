# Authorization

This example shows how to allow only users in certain roles to access a particular action.

You can read a quickstart for this sample [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/aspnet-core/08-authorization). 

## Getting Started

Please refer to the quickstart linked above for details on how to create the Rule required to run this application.

To run this quickstart you can fork and clone this repo.

Be sure to update the `appsettings.json` with your Auth0 settings:

```json
{
  "Auth0": {
    "Domain": "Your Auth0 domain",
    "ClientId": "Your Auth0 Client Id",
    "ClientSecret": "Your Auth0 Client Secret",
    "CallbackUrl": "http://localhost:5000/signin-auth0"
  } 
}
```

Then restore the NuGet packages and run the application:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
dotnet restore

# Run
dotnet run
```

You can shut down the web server manually by pressing Ctrl-C.

## Important Snippets

### 1. Specify the Roles who can access a particular action

```csharp
// /Controllers/HomeController.cs

[Authorize(Roles = "admin")]
public IActionResult Admin()
{
    return View();
}
```
